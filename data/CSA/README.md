M-CSA has >4000 residues marked within catalytic sites of <1000 proteins.
They're indicated with PDB id.
Agnese mapped them to uniprot entries, which means we have the AF entries as they follow the uniprot naming.
Then the AF protein topology outputs were collected and the plots were made in notebook and other data available on mediaflux.
Here, I ran PH directly on the experimental structures.
The thing to gain from this is another validation of the applicability of AF.
