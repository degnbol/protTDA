The control dataset of 855 genes and 6130 variants:

As described in the paper currently available from
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283619302037
the control was used to check if the distance metrics (such as breaking disulphide bonds, salt bridges and hydrogen bonds) were giving false positives.
This was done by recomputing wild-type residues with SCWRL4 and excluding proteins where the recomputation gave differences to distance metrics.
